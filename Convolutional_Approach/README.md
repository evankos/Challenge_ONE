A Multi-column DNN seems to be the approach that gives the best results for the image classification
task so far. The technique is described in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2745v1.pdf
And the practical implementations can be done using theano in python

Here is a good getting started tutorial.

For theano you will need to have python 2.7 numpy and scipy installed. Lets keep this project 
in python 2.7 and not go 3.4. Installations in linux systems are pretty straight forward
but in windows i would recommend precompiled package for scipy and the rest installed with pip.

A good git client you can use is the following

If the test script runs correctly you have completed all the necessary installations sucessfuly.
